## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start?
```powershell
# Check if .env exists in backend/
cd backend
type .env

# If missing, create it:
echo PORT=5001 >> .env
echo MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri >> .env
```

### Frontend shows connection error?
```powershell
# Check if .env exists in frontend/
cd frontend
type .env

# If missing, create it:
echo REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api >> .env
```

### MongoDB connection failed?
1. Open `backend/.env`
2. Verify MONGODB_URI is correct
3. Check MongoDB Atlas:
   - Cluster is running
   - IP whitelisted (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Username/password correct

### Port 5001 already in use?
```powershell
# Find and kill process
netstat -ano | findstr :5001
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```
